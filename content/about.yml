    In February 2017, the firm became the first Philippine-based law firm to establish an office in New York City through its affiliate, Gulapa & Baclay LLP. Earlier in 2017 as well, the firm sought to expand its capabilities, particularly by developing its litigation practice.


    In June 2018, Gulapa Law established a representative office in San Francisco to liaise with its US West Coast-based clients with Philippine bound legal concerns.


    With a view to harnessing its lawyers’ talents and tapping into global markets, the firm actively rotates its lawyers in its New York and San Francisco office for training and capacity building.


    Gulapa Law continues to expand globally, transcending borders and servicing more international clients, in line with its vision to continuously innovate, achieve and excel.
