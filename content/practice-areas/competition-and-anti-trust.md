description: The firm advises clients on compliance of arrangements with the
  Philippine Competition Act and the applicability of the law in projects and
  transactions. Due to our competition lawyersâ€™ training abroad, our
  understanding of this area of law goes beyond the text of the Philippine
  Competition Act as the team applies what it has learned in advanced
  competition law jurisdictions such as the US, Japan, Singapore, and the EU.
