description: >
  Competition law is an area that has not been tested before Philippine courts
  and is not traditionally taught in Philippine law schools. Due to our
  competition lawyersâ€™ training abroad, our understanding of this area of law
  goes beyond the text of the new Competition Act. We are able to apply what we
  have learned in advanced competition law jurisdictions such as the US, Japan,
  Singapore, and the EU.
