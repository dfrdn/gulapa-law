Gulapa & Baclay LLP is the New York affiliate of Gulapa Law, a law firm based in the Philippines.  Gulapa Law decided to set up an affiliate in New York City after it was asked by some of its Philippine-based clients to assist them in their US-related matters.

At present, Gulapa Law is already assisting several US companies in their investments and transactions in the Philippines and business collaborations in the ASEAN region. 

Gulapa Law hopes that Gulapa & Baclay LLP would serve as a platform to promote the Philippines as an investment hub and also a gateway to the ASEAN economic region.
