Gulapa Law, a boutique law firm headquartered in the Philippines, registered a representative office in San Francisco in 2018. This is the firm’s second presence outside the Philippines – as well as the second office in the U.S. – after it opened its affiliate, Gulapa & Baclay LLP, in New York City.

Our San Francisco office does not provide legal services or carry out business in California. It merely liaises with our clients on the U.S. West Coast and refers them to the Philippine office.
