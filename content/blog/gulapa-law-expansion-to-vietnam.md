Gulapa Law is expanding its practice to Vietnam through Gulapa & Aguila LLLC – the first in Asia outside of its Manila headquarters. This expansion within Asia heeds the increasing demand for legal services that are responsive to the needs of foreign clients.



Gulapa & Aguila LLLC will be led by its Resident Managing Partner, Katrina Aguila. Gulapa Law’s Vietnam team will be comprised of seasoned Vietnamese and foreign lawyers with demonstrated experience in robust areas of Vietnamese law, including corporate law, foreign direct investments, mergers and acquisitions, real estate and disputes. Central to Gulapa Law’s Vietnam office’s operations is the commitment to support clients in navigating the legal and practical complexities of doing business in Vietnam. To that end, the team ensures that particular attention is paid to bridging communication gaps and an applied understanding of jurisdiction-specific nuances.
